Version: 0.1.0
Author: Shana White, Andy Shapiro
Maintainer: The package maintainer <white.shana@epa.gov>
Description: Benchmark dose (BMD) modeling is the preferred method for
    deriving toxicity values from dose-response data at the US EPA. The US EPA 
    maintians a variety of platforms such that researchers can conduct BMD 
    modeling using online, desktop, command-line or, now, script-based software 
    on the front-end that all use the EPA's approved C++ engine on the back-end.
